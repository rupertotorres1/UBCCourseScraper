# UBCCourseScraper
Used to create the dict used in UBCPreReqTool.

I made this to create the dict of courses and their pre-requisites and co-requisites that I used in UBCPreReqTools.
This program could probably be easily modified to scrape something else (instead of pre-requisites and co-requisites) from
each course's website and create another useful tool.
